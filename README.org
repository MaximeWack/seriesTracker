seriesTracker helps you keep track of the tv shows you watch and always know when new releases get out.

It makes use of the API provided by [[https://www.episodate.com][Episodate]]. Many thanks to them!

* Install

Clone this repo.

* Configure

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package seriesTracker
  :load-path "~/Projects/seriesTracker"

  :config ;;These are the default values
  (setq st--file "~/.emacs.d/st.el"
        st--fold-cycle 'st-all-folded ;; can also be 'st-all-unfolded or 'st-series-folded. Will deternine the folding at startup
        st-show-watched "hide" ;; whether to hide or "show" the watched episodes
        st-sorting-type "next")) ;; or "alpha" for alphabetic sort
#+end_src>

* Usage

Run ~st~ to start *seriesTracker*.

Press ~A~ to search for a series and add it to the tracker.

The controls are outline-like :
- ~p/n~ to move by line
- ~C-p/n~ to move by header
- ~C-u~ to go up a level
- ~C-b/f~ to move by header of the same level
- ~C-d/e~ to un/fold
- ~TAB~ to cycle visibility


Press ~w~ to watch the episode/season/series under point, or a visual selection. You can also press ~u~ to watch all episodes up to the one under point.
Press ~W~ to toggle displaying episodes that have already been watched.

You can also access a transient popup /Ã  la/ magit by pressing ~h~. In addition to being a cheatsheet, it allows you to manually save/load, as well as set the savefile. You can also set the sorting strategy there (alphabetically or by next episode to watch).

Although you can manually update the database by pressing ~U~, running ~st~ updates on startup.
Quitting with ~q~ autosaves to ~st--file~.
